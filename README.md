# GroupRules

## Source Integrity & Reliability

Anchor all financial discussions in trusted, authoritative sources, such as Coinbase (for crypto), established financial news services (e.g., Bloomberg, Reuters, Financial Times), regulatory filings, or official disclosures.
No speculation without context—when discussing rumors or unverified news, clearly label them as such and cite your source.

## Scope of Discussion: Stick to Financial Relevance
Avoid political discussion unless it's directly and imminently affecting investment or market fundamentals (e.g., a newly passed tax law).
Discussions must remain on-topic, focused on market trends, company performance, regulation, risk analysis, etc.

## Etiquette, Tone & Constructiveness
Be respectful and courteous: no insults, harassment, or ad hominem attacks. Encourage constructive disagreement—healthy debate is valuable when focused on ideas, not individuals. Stay on-topic—off-topic chatter should be minimal 

## Not Financial Advice
Conversations are informational only—not professional financial advice. Remind participants to do their own due diligence. 

## Transparency & Disclosures
If you have a financial interest or vested interest in a topic, disclose it upfront. Otherwise no solicitation, promotion of products, services unless. Avoid conflicts of interest, or clearly state them, especially if sharing opinions that may impact markets or discussions.

## Confidentiality & Privacy
Messages udeally should stay within the group. This is more an ettiqutte rather than a rule. If you want to share someone elses information please ask for permission first. Avoid posting personal or sensitive financial information (yours or others’). Grey/black out your balances if sharing an account publically. 

## Moderation, Reporting & Sanctions
It is expected that everyone will abide by these rules out of courtesy and respect to colleagues and friends. If escalation is required first warning → temporary mute → removal may be considered.
